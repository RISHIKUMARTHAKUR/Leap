# 🌐 Leap Career Catalyst

A career-launch platform built to empower 1M+ Indian international students in the US with hands-on experience, referrals, and industry-aligned skills — helping them break the "fresher" tag and land top jobs.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Each year, over 1,000,000 Indian students go abroad to study — but most face immense challenges when pursuing a career in a foreign land:
